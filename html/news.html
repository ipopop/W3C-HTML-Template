                    The cultivation of the domesticated grape began 6,000â€“8,000 years ago in the Near East. Yeast, one of the earliest domesticated microorganisms, occurs naturally on the skins of grapes, leading to the innovation of alcoholic drinks such as wine. The earliest archeological evidence for a dominant position of wine-making in human culture dates from 8,000 years ago in Georgia.
                    The oldest winery was found in Armenia, dating to around 4000 BC. By the 9th century AD the city of
                    Shiraz was known to produce some of the finest wines in the Middle East. Thus it has been proposed
                    that Syrah red wine is named after Shiraz, a city in Persia where the grape was used to make Shirazi
                    wine. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics record the cultivation of purple grapes, and history attests to
                    the ancient Greeks, Phoenicians, and Romans growing purple grapes for both eating and wine
                    production. The growing of grapes would later spread to other regions in Europe, as well as North
                    Africa, and eventually in North America. In North America, native grapes belonging to various
                    species of the Vitis genus proliferate in the wild across the continent, and were a part of the diet
                    of many Native Americans, but were considered by European colonists to be unsuitable for wine. Vitis
                    vinifera cultivars were imported for that purpose.

                    Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters of 15 to 300, and can be crimson, black, dark blue, yellow, green, orange, and pink. "White" grapes are actually green in color, and are evolutionarily derived from the purple grape. Mutations in two regulatory genes of white grapes turn off production of anthocyanins, which are responsible for the color of purple grapes. Anthocyanins and other pigment chemicals of the larger family of polyphenols in purple grapes are responsible for the varying shades of purple in red wines. Grapes are typically an ellipsoid shape resembling a prolate spheroid.

                    The apple tree (Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the rose family best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the apple. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.

                    Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

                <p>
                    Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 80.8 million tonnes, with China accounting for 49% of the total.

                    The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 1.8 to 4.6 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to 39 ft (12 m) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.
